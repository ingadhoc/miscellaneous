=======
Base UX
=======

Several Improvements:
    * New button to archive/unarchive a mail template in mail template form view.
    * New button to archive/unarchive a company in company form view.
    * New button to add/remove a window action as a contextual action in the windows source model.
    * If a partner is Actived/Archived will be tracked in its message log.
    * When a user marks an activity as done it will be marked done by him instead of mark as done by the activity assigned user
    * Let us to search by exact source the translated terms
    * Be able to use re python library and odoo.tools.html2plaintext()function in server actions, ir.cron, base.automation, etc.
    * Make parent field on res.company invisible as it is useless now
    * New generic wizard that leave us to merge records of any model, By the moment this can be used only via migration script or server action.
    * Keep the activity's description when changing the activity type, regardless of the activity type's description, and change the activity user only if the activity type has a default user.

    **NOTE:** In order to use it you can go to server actions menu, search by "Merge Records" action and there:

    1. Change the action's model to the model of the records you want to merge.
    2. Add a contextual action in order to see "Merge Records" in the More menu when reviewing list view.
    3. You can also specify the field_list you like in order to pre visualizate the values of the records you want to merge in order to select which will be the final record.
